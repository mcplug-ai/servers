# Context7 (Fork)

This is a fork of the original [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) MCP server created by [Upstash](https://upstash.com). The original project is a powerful tool that provides up-to-date documentation and code examples for LLMs and AI code editors.

## About the Original Project

Context7 solves a critical problem in AI-assisted development: outdated documentation. The original project by Upstash allows AI assistants to access current, version-specific documentation directly within your prompts, eliminating the need to switch tabs or rely on outdated training data.

Key features of the original Context7:

- Real-time access to up-to-date documentation
- Version-specific code examples
- Integration with popular AI code editors
- Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks

## This Fork

This fork maintains the core functionality of the original Context7 while adapting it to the mcplug format. It provides two main tools:

- **resolve_library_id**: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID
- **get_library_docs**: Fetches comprehensive documentation for a specific library
